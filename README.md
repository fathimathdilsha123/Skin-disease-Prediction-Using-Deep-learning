# Skin-disease-Prediction-Using-Deep-learning
"Deep learning project for skin disease classification using DermNet dataset. Implemented EfficientNetV2, ConvNeXt, and Vision Transformer with pre processing, augmentation, class weighting, and Grad-CAM for explainable AI in clinical decision support."

# Features
- Data Preprocessing & augmentation for robust model training  
- Class imbalance handling using weighted loss
- Implemented EfficientNetV2B0, ConvNeXtTiny, and Vision Transformer (ViT).
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices  
- **Explainable AI** with Grad-CAM heatmaps
  
- # Dataset
- **DermNet** dataset (Kaggle) containing dermatological images across multiple skin disease categories.  
- Preprocessed to handle class imbalance, noise, and visual similarity.
  
# Results
- Highest accuracy: Vision Transformer (73%)
- Supports 6-class classification
